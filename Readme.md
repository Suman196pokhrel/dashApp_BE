## Overview

`dashApp_BE` is the backend part of the larger project, `dashApp`, which constitutes a fullstack web application designed to streamline and enhance user interactions. This backend is built using Python's FastAPI framework, utilizing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 for robust database management. SQLAlchemy acts as the bridge between Python and PostgreSQL, providing efficient communication. The project also employs Alembic for seamless database migrations.

## Features

#### Authentication

- User registration and login functionalities.
- JWT token-based authentication for secure interactions.
- Forgot password endpoint with OTP sent to the user's email.
- Data validation using Python class schemas with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) library.
